# Shader Readme 
## This is my first wrriten process update for my masters thesis. 
### I will be creating a Paritcle system in THREE.js for my final project. 

The first step for this process was learning GLSL. More specifically Fragment Shaders,<br>
which are the colors, and motion of the pixels to be placed on a 2D or 3D object. 

I had a real brief understanding of GLSL from some self learning the year prior. 

## I started this project by doing this tutorial series: [Shader Tutorial Series] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIvNePu7UEE&list=PL4neAtv21WOmIrTrkNO3xCyrxg4LKkrF7) 

I learned the basics of Fragment shaders as well as a lot of advanced Fragment shader techniques. 
All of Fragment shaders that I created were animated using a combination of the uniforms u_time and u_mouse. 
## After each Tutorial video I would spend some time adjusting values, adding new motion, and messing with color to remix the result. 

# Here are screen captures of my favorite remixes.
